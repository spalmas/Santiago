- *GrndCvrClassification.R*: computes correlation between ground covers and reponse variables such as number of species and number of trees

- *Mortality-ResproutingTest.rmd*: Tries to find differences in mortality and resprouting according to tree type

- *Santiago_LandUse_Trees.Rmd*: Probably main file. Finds correlation between BA Biomass, Tree cover and with estrato. Correlation between BA, Biomass, Tree Cover with comuna, lat/long. Correlation between BA, Biomass, Tree Cover with groundcover

- *Santiago_PrepareDataframes.Rmd*: prepares de dataframes from the original data

- *Santiago_Tree_Growth.Rmd*: Script to fit DAP, BA and Biomass growth model per species or classification of species The arboles_ growth.xls file is generated from Santiago_PrepareDataframes.Rmd

- *helpers.R*: function to estimate biomass for each tree according to species.
